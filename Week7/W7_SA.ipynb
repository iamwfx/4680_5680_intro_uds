    "The notion of spatial autocorrelation relates to the existence of a \"functional relationship between what happens at one point in space and what happens elsewhere\" {cite}`Anselin_1988`. **Spatial autocorrelation thus has to do with the degree to which the similarity in values between observations in a dataset is related to the similarity in locations of such observations.** \n",
    "\n",
    "## Understanding Spatial Autocorrelation\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to better understand the notion of spatial autocorrelation, it is useful to begin by considering what the world looks like in its absence. A key idea in this context is that of spatial randomness: **a situation in which the location of an observation gives no information whatsoever about its value**. In other words, a variable is spatially random if its distribution follows no discernible spatial pattern. Spatial autocorrelation can thus be defined as the \"absence of spatial randomness\". \n",
    "\n",
    "This definition is still too vague, though. So, to get more specific, spatial autocorrelation is typically categorized along two main dimensions: **sign** and **scale**. Similar to the traditional, non-spatial case, spatial autocorrelation can adopt two main forms: **positive** and **negative**. The former relates to a situation where similarity and geographical closeness go hand-in-hand. In other words, similar values are located near each other, while different values tend to be scattered and further away. It is important that the sign of these values is not relevant for the presence of spatial autocorrelation: it may be high values close to high values, *or* low values close to low values. The important bit in this context is the relationship between closeness and statistical similarity is positive. This is a fairly common case in many social contexts and, in fact, several human phenomena display  clearly positive spatial autocorrelation. **For example, think of the distribution of income, or poverty, over space: it is common to find similar values located nearby (wealthy areas close to other wealthy areas, poor population concentrated in space too).** In contrast, **negative** spatial autocorrelation reflects a situation where similar values tend to be located away from each other. In this case, statistical similarity is associated with distance. This is somewhat less common in the social sciences, but it still exists. An example can be found in phenomena that follow processes of spatial competition or situations where the location of a set of facilities aims at the highest spatial coverage. **The distribution of supermarkets of different brands, or of hospitals usually follows a pattern of negative spatial dependence.**\n",
    "\n",
    "It can also help to understand spatial autocorrelation using the scale at which it is considered. We generally talk of global or local processes. **Global** spatial autocorrelation, on which this chapter is focused on, considers the overall trend that the location of values follows. In doing this, the study of global spatial autocorrelation makes possible statements about the degree of *clustering* in the dataset. Do values generally follow a particular pattern in their geographical distribution? Are similar values closer to other similar values than we would expect from pure chance? These are some of the questions that relate to global spatial autocorrelation. **Local** autocorrelation focuses on deviations from the global trend at much more focused levels than the entire map, and it is the subject of the next chapter.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will explore these concepts with an applied example, interrogating the data about the presence, nature, and strength of global spatial autocorrelation. To do this, we will use a set of tools collectively known as Exploratory Spatial Data Analysis (ESDA). Analogous to its non-spatial counterpart (EDA; {cite}`Tukey1977exploratory`), ESDA has been specifically designed for this purpose, and puts space and the relative location of the observations in a dataset at the forefront of the analysis. The range of ESDA methods is wide and spans from simpler approaches like choropleth maps (previous chapter), to more advanced and robust methodologies that include statistical inference and an explicit recognition of the geographical arrangement of the data. The purpose of this chapter is to dip our toes into the latter group."

    "The map above is a good way to begin exploring the main spatial patterns in the data. At first sight, it appears to display a fair amount of positive spatial autocorrelation: local authorities with high percentages of votes to leave the EU tend to be next to each other (see, for instance, the eastern region), as are those where a much smaller proportion of their population voted to leave (with Scotland being a good example in the north). By looking at the map above, for example, we can have an educated guess about the presence of spatial autocorrelation; **but actually determining whether what we are seeing could have come from pure chance or not is usually easier said than done**.\n",

These are statistics to characterize a map in terms of its degree of clustering and summarize it, either in a visual or numerical way. However, before we can delve into the statistics, we need to understand a core building block: the **spatial lag**. With that concept under the belt, we are in a position to build a good understanding of global spatial autocorrelation. We will gently enter it with the binary case, when observations can only take two (potentially categorical) values, before we cover the two workhorses of the continuous case: the Moran Plot and Moran's I."

Because non-neighbors receive a weight of zero, $y_{sl-i}$ really captures the product of values and weights for $i$'s neighbors. If $\\textbf{W}$ is binary, this will amount to the sum of the values of $i$'s neighbors (useful in some contexts, such as studies of market potential); if $W$ is row standardized, a common transformation, then $w_{ij}$ is bounded between zero and one; the spatial lag thus then becomes a \"**local average**,\" the average value of $Y$ in the neighborhood of each observation $i$.

This, however, does not mean that this is the only case in the dataset: there can of course be particular situations where high values are surrounded by low ones, and *vice versa*. But it means that, if we had to summarize the main pattern of the data in terms of how clustered similar values are, the best way would be to say they are positively correlated and, hence, clustered over space. In the context of the example, this can be interpreted along the lines of: local authorities where people voted in high proportion to leave the EU tend to be located nearby other regions that also registered high proportions of Leave vote.

If we remember again that the value of Moran's I can also be interpreted as the slope of the Moran Plot, what we have is that, in this case, the particular spatial arrangement of values over space we observe for the percentage of Leave votes is more concentrated than if we were to randomly shuffle the vote proportions among the map, hence the statistical significance. As a first step, the global autocorrelation analysis can teach us that observations do seem to be positively autocorrelated over space. Indeed, the overall spatial pattern in the EU Referendum vote was highly marked: nearby areas tended to vote alike.\n",

    "Local measures of spatial autocorrelation focus on the relationships between _each_ observation and its surroundings, rather than providing a single summary of these relationships across the map. In this sense, **they are not summary statistics but scores that allow us to learn more about the spatial structure in our data**. The general intuition behind the metrics however is similar to that of global ones. Some of them are even mathematically connected, where the global version can be decomposed into a collection of local ones. One such example are Local Indicators of Spatial Association (LISAs) {cite}`Anselin1995local`, which we use to build the understanding of local spatial autocorrelation, and on which we spend a good part of the chapter. \n",

In fact, the application of these methods to large surfaces is a promising area of work. For that reason, we close the chapter with an illustration of how one can run these statistics on data stored as surfaces."

Remember we are calculating a statistic for every single observation in the data so, if we have many of them, it will be difficult to extract any meaningful pattern. In this context, a choropleth can help. At first glance, this may seem to suggest that a choropleth of the $I_i$  values would be a useful way to visualize the spatial distribution. We can see such map in the top-left panel of the figure below and, while it tells us whether the local association is positive (HH/LL) or negative (HL/LH), it cannot tell, for example, whether the yellow areas in Scotland are similar to those in the eastern cluster of yellow areas. Are the two experiencing similar patterns of spatial association, or is one of them HH and the other LL? Also, we know that values around zero will not be statistically significant. Which local statistics are thus significant and which ones non-significant from a statistical point of view? In other words, which ones can be considered statistical clusters and which ones mere noise?\n",

The latter is useful if we need to work with them as part of a broader data pipeline. So far, cluster maps have been handled by `splot`, but there is quite a bit that happens under the hood. If we needed to recreate one of its maps, or to use this information in a different context, we would need to extract them out of our `lisa` object, and link them up to the original `db` table. Here is one way you can do this.\n",

    "\n",
    "Let us stop for a second on these two steps. First, we consider the `sig` column. Akin to global Moran's I, `esda` automatically computes a pseudo p-value for each LISA. Because some instances of the LISA statistics may not be statistically significant, we want to identify those with a p-value small enough that rules out the possibility of obtaining a similar value in random maps. A few different ways of generating random maps are considered by `esda`, but we focus on a strategy that actually simulates hundreds of thousands of random maps to get a rough idea of the possible local statistic values at each local authority given the data we saw. In addition, we follow a similar reasoning as with global Moran's I and use 5% as the threshold for statistical significance. To identify these values, we create a variable, `sig`, that contains `True` if the p-value of the observation satisfies the condition, and `False` otherwise.\n",

    "Next, we construct our quadrant values using the `q` attribute which records the Moran Scatterplot quadrant for each local value. However, we now mask these values using the newly created binary significance measure `sig`, so only observations in a quadrant that are considered significant are labeled as part of that given quadrant. The remainder are labelled as non-significant."

    "These cluster labels are meaningful if you know of the Moran Plot. To help making them a bit more intuitive, a terminology that is sometimes used goes as follows. Positive forms of local spatial autocorrelation are of two types. First, HH observations, which we can term \"hot spots\", represent areas where values at the site and its surroundings are larger than average. Second, LL observations, significant clusters of low values surrounded by low values, are sometimes referred to as \"cold spots\". Negative forms of local spatial autocorrelation also include two cases. When the focal observation displays low values but its surroundings have high values (LH), we call them \"doughnuts\". Conversely, areas with high values but neighboured by others with low values (HL) can be referred to as \"diamonds in the rough\". We note this terminology is purely mnemonic, but recognise in some cases it can help remembering the interpretation of local statistics. "
