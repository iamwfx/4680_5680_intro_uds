    "The Citi Bike program in New York City is a bike-sharing initiative that provides residents and visitors with access to bicycles for short-term rentals. It was launched in New York City in May 2013, making it one of the oldest and most established bike-sharing programs in the United States. The program caters to a diverse range of users, including commuters, tourists, and residents of New York City. \n",
    "\n",
    "Citi Bike makes siting decisions based on a combination of factors, including **population density**, **transportation needs**, and **input from the community**. The program continually evaluates and adjusts the locations of its bike stations to meet the evolving demand for bike-sharing services. \n",
    "\n",
    "**For this exercise, we are going to consider a simplified version of these factors and help Citibike figure out 10 block groups to put new bike stations in.**\n",
