    "# 1. Predicting HOLC grades\n",
    "In this exercise, you are going to explore some historical Census data and understand its relationships with the Home Owners' Loan Corporation (HOLC) risk maps. These maps were made by the HOLC in the late 1930s-early 1940s for the HOLC to make assessments of neighborhood risk after the HOLC bailed out underwater borrowers who were unable to pay their mortgage loans as a consequence of the Great Depression. Mortgage risk was assessed with all residential neighborhoods being given an A, B, C, or D grade: \n",
    "\n",
    "- A = \"best\"\n",
    "- B = \"still desirable\"\n",
    "- C = \"definitely declining\"\n",
    "- D = \"hazardous\"\n",
    "\n",
    "While these maps have become known as the \"redlining maps\" note that the agency didn't use these maps to make decisions on who/where should get loans. They actually made these maps after loan activities were already over! However, these maps do provide an interesting window into how the real estate industry viewed different neighborhoods, during a period when redlining (by savings and loan banks, the Federal Housing Administration, amongst others) occurred. In 1968, Congress signed the Fair Housing Act of 1968, also known as Title VIII of the Civil Rights Act of 1968, that formally made discrimination by race, sex, color, religion, disability, family status, and national origin illegal. This is considered by many scholars to be the legal end of discriminatory redlining practices (although they still occur, in various ways, to today). \n",
    "\n",
    "There are three time periods to consider when we're thinking about the \"impacts\" of the redlining: \n",
    "- The pre-redlining period: for now, we'll say that is 1930 and any 1930-1940 trends. \n",
    "- The redlining period: 1940 - 1970\n",
    "- The post-redlining period: 1980 - present\n",
    "\n",
    "The overall aim of this study is to understand whether we think there is a relationship between HOLC grades and present-day outcomes in racial outcomes and neighborhood outcomes such as education or median income. The underlying mechanism here might be that HOLC grades led to disinvestment in neighborhoods, which leads to poor conditions, the concentration of poverty, and low opportunities for people who live in that neighborhood. This leads us to test two scenarios: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Can we use neighborhood conditions to predict historical HOLC grades during the period of redlining? \n",
    "2. Similarly, if we think that grades were also determined by neighborhood socioeconomic and demographic conditions, can we use these to predict HOLC grades? "
