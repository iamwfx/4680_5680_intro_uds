    "\n",
    "**Geopandas** is a python library that allows us to ingest, analyze, and map geospatial vector data. It combines what we have learned in the previous two classes: The tabular data analysis tools in **Pandas** with the geometry handling of shapely. Under the hood, it is using a python library called **fiona**, which handles all different kinds of spatial file formats, and **pyproj**, which manages our coordinate reference systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main data structures in Geopandas are GeoDataFrames and GeoSeries, which are intended to mirror the Pandas DataFrame and Series structures. \n",
    "\n",
    "The key distinction in Geopandas is that we will always a column called `geometry` like so that contains the geometries related to each row: \n",
