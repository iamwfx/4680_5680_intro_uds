    "\"Spatial weights\" are one way to represent graphs in geographic data science and spatial statistics. They are widely used constructs that represent geographic relationships between the observational units in a spatially referenced dataset. Implicitly, spatial weights connect objects in a geographic table to one another using the spatial relationships between them. **By expressing the notion of geographical proximity or connectedness, spatial weights are the main mechanism through which the spatial relationships in geographical data is brought to bear in the subsequent analysis.**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Spatial weights often express our knowledge about spatial relationships. \n",
    "For example, proximity and adjacency are common spatial questions: *What neighborhoods are you surrounded by? How many gas stations are within 5 miles of my stalled car?*\n",
    "These are spatial questions that target specific information about the spatial configuration of a specific target (\"a neighborhood,\" \"my stalled car\") and geographically connected relevant sites (\"adjacent neighborhoods\", \"nearby gas stations\"). For us to use this information in statistical analysis, it's often necessary to compute these relationships between all pairs of observations. This means that, for many applications in geographic data science, we are building a *topology*---a mathematical structure that expresses the connectivity between observations---that we can use to examine the data. Spatial weights matrices express this topology, letting us embed all of our observations in space together, rather than asking and answering single questions about features nearby a unit. \n",

    "Spatial weights are central to how we *represent* spatial relationships in mathematical and computational environments. At their core, they are a \"geo-graph,\" or a network defined by the geographical relationships between observations. They form kind of a \"spatial index,\" in that they record which observations have a specific geographical relationship. Since spatial weights are fundamental to how spatial relationships are represented in geographic data science, we will use them again and again throughout the book. "

    "While every node in a $k$-nearest neighbor graph has 5 neighbors, there is a conceptual difference between *in-degree* and *out-degree* of nodes in a graph. \n",
    "\n",
    "The *out-degree* of a node is the number of outgoing links from a node; for a K-Nearest Neighbor graph, this is $k$ for every variable. The *in-degree* of a node in a graph is the number of *incoming* links to that node; for a K-Nearest Neighbor graph, this is the number of other observations that pick the target as their nearest neighbor. The *in-degree* of a node in the K-Nearest Neighbor graph can provide a measure of *hubbiness*, or how central a node is to other nodes. \n",

    "1. Using the San Diego Tracts data, build a $k=6$ nearest neighbor weight and call it `knn_6`. \n",
    "2. Verify that the $k=6$ by taking the row sum over the weights matrix in `knn_6.sparse`.\n",
    "3. Compute the in-degree of each observation by taking the *column sum* over the weights matrix in `knn_6.sparse`, and divide by 6, the out-degree for all observations. \n",
    "4. Make a histogram of the in-degrees for the $k=6$ weights. How evenly-distributed is the distribution of in-degrees?\n",
    "5. Make a new histogram of the in-degree standardized by the out-degree when $k=26$. Does hubbiness reduce when increasing the number of $k$-nearest neighbors?\n"
